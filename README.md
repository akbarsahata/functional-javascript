## Introduction

In this repository, I explore the world of functional programming using JavaScript as the primary language. Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes writing code in a declarative and immutable manner, focusing on pure functions and avoiding shared state and side effects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have Node.js and a code editor installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. From there, you can explore the code examples, run the exercises, and dive into the resources provided.

## Topics Covered

Throughout this learning journey, I cover various topics related to functional programming in JavaScript, including:

- Currying
- and more...

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` directory contains a collection of practical code snippets that demonstrate different functional programming concepts in JavaScript. Feel free to explore and experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding.

## Resources

In the `resources` directory, you will find a curated list of articles, tutorials, books, and videos that I have found helpful in my learning process. These resources provide further explanations, insights, and practical examples to enhance your understanding of functional programming in JavaScript.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional resources that you would like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
